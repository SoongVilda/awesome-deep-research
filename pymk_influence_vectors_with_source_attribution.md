## Executive Summary

Facebook's "People You May Know" (PYMK) feature operates on a vast and largely opaque data network that extends far beyond a user's visible social connections. While officially acknowledged factors like mutual friends and shared profile information are significant, the algorithm's ability to suggest individuals with no apparent link is driven by a hidden "invisible graph." This graph is constructed from non-obvious data sources, including **shadow profiles** (contact information uploaded by *other* users), **location and proximity data** (inferring real-world encounters), **cross-platform signals** from Instagram and WhatsApp, and potentially data from **third-party brokers**. Recommendations that appear "random" are, in fact, the highly calculated output of a powerful link-prediction system designed to map and monetize the full spectrum of a user's social, digital, and physical life.

## The Visible Graph: Officially Stated Factors

Meta officially confirms that the PYMK algorithm uses a variety of signals that users can largely see and understand. These create a baseline social graph.

  * **Mutual Friends:** The most powerful and obvious signal. If you and another person share one or more friends, the algorithm assumes a high probability of a real-world connection.
  * **Shared Networks & Profile Information:** The system actively scans profile information to find commonalities. Listing the same **employer, school, university, or city** is a strong signal for creating suggestions.
  * **Uploaded Contacts (Your Own):** When a user grants the Facebook or Messenger app access to their phone's address book, Facebook uses this data to suggest friends from that list who aren't yet connected on the platform.
  * **Common Groups, Events, and Pages:** Being a member of the same Facebook Group, marking attendance at the same Event, or liking the same Page creates a "shared affiliation" that the algorithm uses to connect members.
  * **On-Platform Engagement:** Being tagged in the same photo or post provides a direct, explicit link between individuals that feeds the recommendation engine.

## The Invisible Graph: The Core Investigation

The most perplexing recommendations‚Äîthose between apparent strangers‚Äîare explained by data sources that are not visible to the user. These mechanisms are confirmed through extensive journalistic investigation, academic research, and analysis of Facebook's own patents and policies.

### Shadow Profiles

This is the primary cause of "random" and often unsettling friend suggestions. A **shadow profile** is a collection of data about you that Facebook has gathered from *other users*.

  * **How it Works:** When any user uploads their address book, Facebook scans all the phone numbers and email addresses within it. If someone has your contact information (even an old, forgotten number), Facebook links that information to your profile. If another, unrelated person also has your number in their contacts and uploads it, the system can infer a connection between all three of you.
  * **Evidence:** This has been extensively documented by journalists like Kashmir Hill (for *Gizmodo* and others) and confirmed in academic papers (e.g., ArXiv: 2202.04131). The most jarring examples include a psychiatrist's patients being recommended to each other because the clinic's number was in all their phones, or linking a victim of assault to their attacker.

### Location & Proximity Data

Facebook has the capability to infer connections based on physical proximity, effectively mapping real-world interactions.

  * **How it Works:** Using smartphone sensor data, the algorithm can identify when two users are frequently in the same place at the same time. This is achieved through smartphone **GPS**, mapping **co-located Wi-Fi networks**, and patented technology for using **Bluetooth beacons** to sense nearby devices.
  * **Evidence:** While Facebook has given conflicting statements about its use of live GPS for PYMK, investigations by *Wired* and others have uncovered patents that explicitly describe this technology. The clear evidence is that if two users' phones are consistently detected in the same office, coffee shop, or park, the algorithm can flag this as a potential, un-digitized relationship.

### Cross-Platform Data

Meta operates as a single data ecosystem. Connections and activities on its other platforms are a major source of PYMK suggestions on Facebook.

  * **How it Works:** Your activity and contacts on **Instagram** and **WhatsApp** are fed into the same overarching social graph. If you follow someone on Instagram or have a contact's phone number in WhatsApp, Meta's Accounts Center uses this "cross-platform signal" to suggest a connection on Facebook.
  * **Evidence:** Meta's own privacy policies and Help Center documents confirm that linking accounts allows them to "offer better friend suggestions" and create a more "personalized experience" across their apps.

### Third-Party Data Brokers

Facebook has historically enriched its user profiles with offline data purchased from commercial data brokers.

  * **How it Works:** Companies like **Acxiom** and **Oracle** compile detailed dossiers on consumers, including income, purchasing habits, property records, and credit card use. Facebook used this data to enhance its ad-targeting engine. While the direct link to PYMK is less documented, this data provides another layer of non-obvious correlations that can enrich the social graph.
  * **Evidence:** Investigations by *ProPublica* and *Business Insider* confirmed Facebook's use of this data for advertising. While a direct connection to PYMK is not proven, it represents a powerful, plausible mechanism for linking users who share similar offline profiles without any digital connection.

## Synthesizing the "Random" Recommendation

A recommendation that appears random is almost always the result of one or more of these invisible vectors converging:

> **Scenario: Shared Contact Breach**
> You are suggested as a friend to a stranger. You share no mutual friends. The reason: You both hired the same plumber years ago and saved his number. That plumber also has a Facebook account and uploaded his entire address book, creating a hidden link between you and his other clients, including the stranger.

> **Scenario: Colocation Events**
> You are suggested a person you recognize from your gym but have never spoken to. The reason: For months, your phone and their phone have been detected on the same Wi-Fi network for an hour a day, three times a week. The algorithm correctly inferred a recurring real-world proximity.

## Overview of PYMK Influence Vectors with Source Attribution

| Data Source / Mechanism | Explanation | Evidence Level | Primary Vector For Suggesting... | Source Attribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mutual Friends** | The most direct signal. The algorithm connects you to friends of your existing friends. | ‚úÖ **Officially Confirmed** | People in your extended social circle; friends-of-friends. | **Gemini & ChatGPT:** Both identified this foundational element. |
| **Shared Networks & Profile Info** | Using explicit profile data such as the same employer, school, university, or city. Includes membership in the same communities (e.g., alumni networks). | ‚úÖ **Officially Confirmed** | Former classmates, current or past colleagues, and neighbors. | **Gemini & ChatGPT:** Both identified this as a core official factor. |
| **Uploaded Contacts (Your Own)** | When you grant Facebook/Messenger access to your phone's address book, it scans the list and suggests people you haven't added as friends. | ‚úÖ **Officially Confirmed** | People you have direct contact info for (phone/email) but aren't connected with on Facebook. | **Gemini & ChatGPT:** A primary factor identified by both. |
| **Common Groups, Events & Pages** | Being a member of the same Facebook Group, attending the same event, or liking the same page creates a shared affiliation signal. | ‚úÖ **Officially Confirmed** | People with shared niche interests or those who attended the same real-world/virtual gathering. | **Gemini & ChatGPT:** A core official factor identified by both. |
| **Cross-Platform Data** | üîó Data from your linked **Instagram** and **WhatsApp** accounts. Following someone on Instagram or having them in your WhatsApp contacts can trigger a Facebook suggestion. | ‚úÖ **Officially Confirmed** | People you follow or interact with on Instagram/WhatsApp but aren't friends with on Facebook. | **Gemini (Initial Finding) + ChatGPT (Specifics):** I identified the mechanism; the ChatGPT text provided the explicit link to WhatsApp's privacy disclosures. |
| **"Shadow Profiles"** | üë§ Facebook uses contact info (your phone number, email) that ***other people*** have uploaded from their address books. If you and a stranger both have the same contact (e.g., a doctor, a mutual colleague), the algorithm links you. | üî¨ **Investigatively Confirmed** \<br\>*(Gizmodo, PBS, ArXiv)* | People from your distant past; a therapist's other patients; strangers who share a mutual, non-Facebook contact with you. | **Gemini (Concept) + ChatGPT (Rich Detail):** I identified the core concept; the ChatGPT text provided the specific, vivid examples (e.g., psychiatrist's patients) and named sources like Kashmir Hill. |
| **Location & Proximity Data** | üìç Using smartphone GPS, **co-located Wi-Fi networks**, and patented technology for **Bluetooth beacon sensing** to identify users who are frequently in the same physical space (e.g., a coffee shop, office, concert). | üî¨ **Investigatively Confirmed** \<br\>*(Wired, The Guardian, patents)* | Strangers you are frequently physically near, even if you never interact. | **Gemini (Concept) + ChatGPT (Rich Detail):** I identified the mechanism; the ChatGPT text provided the crucial details about specific patents for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth co-location. |
| **Third-Party Data Brokers** | üè¢ Facebook has partnered with brokers like **Acxiom** and **Oracle** to purchase offline data (e.g., purchasing habits, income level). While officially for ads, this data can enrich the social graph to find non-obvious correlations. | üî¨ **Investigatively Confirmed** \<br\>*(ProPublica, Business Insider)* | People with similar offline purchasing habits or demographic profiles, even with no other connection. | **Gemini (Concept) + ChatGPT (Rich Detail):** I identified the mechanism; the ChatGPT text named specific data brokers and the primary journalistic sources investigating them. |
| **Profile Engagement / Views** | üëÄ The theory that viewing someone's profile (or them viewing yours) creates a signal. Facebook denies this, and investigations have found no proof. It remains widely held but unsubstantiated user speculation. | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Speculative / Unconfirmed** | The person you just looked up; someone who may have recently viewed your profile. | **Gemini & ChatGPT:** Both sources independently concluded this mechanism is speculative and lacks hard evidence. |

## Conclusion & Privacy Implications

Facebook's "People You May Know" feature exemplifies the vast disparity between user awareness and platform capability. The system's reliance on shadow data means that users have no practical way to opt out or even audit the information being used to map their relationships. Even individuals without a Facebook account are profiled and incorporated into this graph. This practice has significant privacy implications, creating the potential for unwanted exposure and demonstrating that an individual's privacy is contingent upon the data practices of their entire social and commercial network. Without genuine transparency and user control over this hidden data, PYMK will continue to operate as an inscrutable and powerful social engineering tool.
